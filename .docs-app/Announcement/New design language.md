# New design language

The PARKSIDE corporate identity provided by LIDL Marketing International was totally revised in the recent past and will appear in public very soon. For that matter the available CAKE UI library and documentation will also be updated in the upcoming weeks to adapt the new brand design. The current published documentation and UI kit can be considered as outdated and shouldn't be used for new projects until this announcement is removed. Please take a first look at arriving changes.

The necessary changes to color, typography and every other element and component will be very comprehensive. Due to expected breaking changes, we will offer a migration guide after the new content is available. Keep in mind that it is mandatory to update your project to the new guidelines.
