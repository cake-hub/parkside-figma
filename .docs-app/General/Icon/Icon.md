# Icons

Icons are  an essential element of design and are also known as pictograms. They can stand individually, be displayed together, or be part of an element.

They support the understanding of an information or function. Symbols are easier to read than text. They are mainly used to identify a function. It can also be used as an infographic or illustration.

---

## General

- The appearance of the icon depends on the usage or context.
- Icons have an original size of **60x60px**.
- The size has to follow the **rule of 8** (8, 16, 24, 32, …).
- In some cases 8x8px icons can have **suboptimal visibility** because of the thineness of the line, and in such cases please contact [CAKE team](mailto:cake@lidl.com) for discussion about possible solutions.

---

## Usage

- Icons can be used for **status**, as **links**, as **navigation**,  to **support** another element (in alerts, buttons, input-fields, etc.) or as  **illustration**.

## Our workflow in Figma

For your convenience we organized colors for interactive icons around the mode (light and dark), context of use (navigation and link) and states (default, active and disabled). All **status icons** are built as components with variants, which means that upon placing a component the drop-down menus for its mode and state are available in the right panel.

Colors for interactive icons | Status icon variant options |
