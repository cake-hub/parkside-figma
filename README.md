# Introduction

There are three different categories under the PARKSIDE brand:

- Workshop (divided into standard and premium performance line)
- Garden
- High pressure

All three categories follow the same design structure. Different colors and textures of each category offer a clear differentiation and enable optimal orientation at the POS.

Design system from CAKE team covers the entire Parkside brand.
